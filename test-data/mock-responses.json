    "beginner": "# Your Insurance Plan Summary\n\n## Understanding Your Plan\n\nThis summary explains your insurance plan in simple terms. Think of your insurance plan as a way to help pay for your medical care.\n\n## Key Numbers\n\n### Deductible\nYour **deductible** is the amount you pay out of your own pocket before your insurance starts helping. It's like a threshold - once you've paid this amount in a year, your insurance kicks in more.\n\n### Out-of-Pocket Maximum\nYour **out-of-pocket maximum** is the most you'll have to pay in a year. Once you reach this amount, your insurance covers 100% of covered services for the rest of the year.\n\n## What You Pay\n\n### Primary Care Visits\nWhen you see your regular doctor (primary care), you typically pay a **copay** - a fixed amount like $20 or $30 per visit.\n\n### Specialist Visits\nSpecialists are doctors who focus on specific areas (like heart doctors or skin doctors). You usually pay a higher copay for these visits.\n\n### Emergency Room\nEmergency room visits usually have a higher copay because they're for urgent situations.\n\n### Urgent Care\nUrgent care centers are for when you need care quickly but it's not an emergency. These often have a moderate copay.\n\n## Preventive Care\n\n**Preventive care** includes things like annual check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings. Many plans cover these at 100% (no cost to you) because they help prevent bigger health problems later.\n\n## Important Rules\n\n### Referrals\nSome plans require you to get a **referral** from your primary doctor before seeing a specialist. This means your regular doctor needs to approve the visit first.\n\n### Prior Authorization\nFor certain procedures or medications, your plan may require **prior authorization** - meaning the insurance company needs to approve it before you get it.\n\n## Network\n\nYour plan likely has a **network** of doctors and hospitals. Staying in-network usually costs less than going out-of-network.\n\n## Prescription Drugs\n\nPrescription medications are often organized into **tiers**:\n- Tier 1: Generic drugs (lowest cost)\n- Tier 2: Preferred brand drugs\n- Tier 3: Non-preferred brand drugs (highest cost)\n\n---\n\n*Note: This is a sample summary. Your actual plan details may vary. Please refer to your full plan document for specific amounts and coverage details.*",
    
    "intermediate": "# Insurance Plan Summary\n\n## Plan Overview\n\nThis summary outlines key aspects of your insurance coverage, including cost-sharing, coverage rules, and network requirements.\n\n## Cost-Sharing Structure\n\n### Deductible\nThe annual deductible represents the amount you must pay before the plan begins covering services (except preventive care, which is typically covered at 100%).\n\n### Out-of-Pocket Maximum\nThe out-of-pocket maximum caps your annual financial responsibility. Once reached, the plan covers 100% of covered services for the remainder of the benefit year.\n\n## Service-Specific Cost Sharing\n\n### Primary Care Provider (PCP)\nPrimary care visits typically require a fixed copay per visit. This applies to routine office visits with your designated primary care physician.\n\n### Specialist Care\nSpecialist consultations generally have a higher copay than primary care visits. Some plans require referrals from your PCP before specialist visits.\n\n### Emergency Services\nEmergency room visits typically have the highest copay due to the urgent nature and higher facility costs.\n\n### Urgent Care\nUrgent care facilities offer a middle ground between primary care and emergency services, with moderate copays.\n\n## Preventive Care Coverage\n\nPreventive services (annual physicals, immunizations, screenings) are typically covered at 100% with no copay or deductible, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n## Utilization Management\n\n### Referral Requirements\nSome plan types (HMOs) require referrals from your PCP before accessing specialist care. PPO plans typically allow direct specialist access.\n\n### Prior Authorization\nCertain services, procedures, or medications require prior authorization from the insurance carrier before services are rendered.\n\n## Network Considerations\n\nIn-network providers have negotiated rates with your insurance carrier, resulting in lower out-of-pocket costs. Out-of-network care typically results in higher costs or may not be covered.\n\n## Prescription Drug Coverage\n\nMedications are typically organized into tiers:\n- **Tier 1**: Generic medications (lowest copay)\n- **Tier 2**: Preferred brand-name drugs\n- **Tier 3**: Non-preferred brand-name drugs (highest copay)\n- **Tier 4**: Specialty medications\n\n---\n\n*Refer to your plan document for specific dollar amounts, coverage limitations, and exclusions.*",
